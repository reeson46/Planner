# Planner web application

### General info
A planner web application similar to HacknPlan, where users can create Boards, on which they can add Categories, and under each category, they can create Tasks with their individual sub-tasks. These components can be as well updated/renamed or deleted.

There is also a possibility to try this application as a Guest user, but it has its own limitations, such as a limited number of maximum Tasks. At any point, a Guest user can be converted into a regular User by Signing Up.
